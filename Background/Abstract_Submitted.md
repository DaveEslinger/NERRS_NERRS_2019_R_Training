# ANALYZING AND PRESENTING YOUR DATA WITH R: TOOLS, TRAINING, AND SUPPORT

## When: Monday, November 18, 8:00 a.m. to noon

This hands-on session will include presentations on new R tools and workflows, provide training on some intermediate R tasks, and offer a “doctor’s office” to provide hands-on help with attendees’ R-related issues. It is intended for those working with SET data, producing System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) status reports, or analyzing data with R. Attendees who want to follow along should bring a laptop with R and RStudio already installed. Instructors can help with install on-site if attendees have administrative privileges on their laptop. RStudio Cloud, which does not require any software to be installed, will also be demonstrated. 

 

The training will start with a demonstration of newer R tools and workflows. This will include handling SET data, new options for the SWMP Reports plots, using SWMPr and SWMPrExtension with non-SWMP data, using RStudio.Cloud, and other frequently asked-about tasks. Next, the trainer will provide a SWMP Status Reports refresher. This includes how to install everything needed, how to handle the inevitable error messages (“It’s not you, it’s R”), how to change text and parameters for each new year, how to do more than the “canned” graphics with SWMPrExtension, and other topics.

 

The end of the training will include a “hacky hour” and “doctor’s office,” which will give participants time to work on individual projects. If you have specific goals to work on, this is a great time. If you’re not currently facing problems, we will provide suggestions of graphs for you to imitate to get you coding on your own. We will have multiple people on hand to help answer questions, address individual challenges, and brainstorm new analyses. Please contact Dave Eslinger (Dave.Eslinger@noaa.gov) in advance of the training to give us a heads-up about your issues. We want this to be a problem-solving exercise, not a stump-the-experts event! If you have a data set you want to examine, please bring it on a thumb drive.
