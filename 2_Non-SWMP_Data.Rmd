## What is a SWMPr data object?
Attributes of a swmpr object include names, row.names, class, station, parameters, qaqc_cols, cens_cols, date_rng, timezone, stamp_class, metabolism (if present), and metab_units (if present).


## Why do we care?

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

## How do we create one with non-SWMP data?

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Using SWMPr with the new data

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
