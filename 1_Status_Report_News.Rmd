## SWMP Status Report Update

- 2018 data has been processed and all graphics are available at CDMO:
  http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/waf/nerrs_swamp_status_reports/
- However, these reports use the old Excel content and R scripts.

That means:

- **Graphs** all scale with 0. as their lowest Y-value.
- **Graphs** all use non-metric units.
- The text and pictures are all from the old, boiler-plate 2016 product.


Graphs and units *may* be a problem

The text, at least, **must** be updated.

## What is New: Lower Y-value can be "float""

- New flag in Excel spreadsheet to specify how Y-axis scaling should work,
and the SWMPrExtension package code updated to use the new flag.

```{r box-plot-news, warning=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.show='hold' }
df <- import_local(path,'jobjbmet2017')
df <- qaqc(df, qaqc_keep = qaFlags)
#raw_boxplot(df, param = 'atemp', plot_title = TRUE, target_yr = '2017')
#raw_boxplot(df, param = 'atemp', plot_title = TRUE, target_yr = '2017', free_y = TRUE)
raw_boxplot(df, param = 'bp', plot_title = TRUE, target_yr = '2017')
raw_boxplot(df, param = 'bp', plot_title = TRUE, target_yr = '2017', free_y = TRUE)
```

## What is New: Lower Y-value can be "float""

- Bug fixes to `seasonal-dot-plot.R` plot code in SWMPrExtension package fixes bug.
